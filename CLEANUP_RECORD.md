## Result

The project now has a clean structure with only essential files and directories:
- `backend/` - Contains the API and processing pipeline
- `my-book/` - Contains the Docusaurus website with integrated chatbot
- Essential configuration files (README.md, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, etc.)
- History and specification directories for project tracking

The core functionality remains intact with the RAG chatbot system fully operational.
